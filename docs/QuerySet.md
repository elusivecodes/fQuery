```

**Has Descendent**

Returns *true* if any of the nodes contains a descendent matching a filter.

- `filter` is either a function that accepts a `node` argument, a query selector string, a *Node*, *HTMLElement*, *DocumentFragment*, *ShadowRoot*, *NodeList*, *HTMLCollection*, *QuerySet* or an array of nodes that the nodes will be tested for.

```javascript

Returns *true* if any of the nodes matches a filter.

- `filter` is either a function that accepts a `node` argument, a query selector string, a *Node*, *HTMLElement*, *DocumentFragment*, *ShadowRoot*, *NodeList*, *HTMLCollection*, *QuerySet* or an array of nodes that the nodes will be tested for.

```javascript
const is = query.is(filter);
```

**Is Connected**

Returns *true* if any of the nodes is connected to the DOM.

```javascript
const isConnected = query.isConnected();
```

**Is Equal**

Returns *true* if any of the nodes is considered equal to any of the other nodes.

- `others` is a query selector string, a *Node*, *HTMLElement*, *DocumentFragment*, *ShadowRoot*, *NodeList*, *HTMLCollection*, *QuerySet* or an array of nodes.

```javascript
const isEqual = query.isEqual(others);
```

**Is Fixed**

Returns *true* if any of the nodes or a parent of any of the nodes is "fixed".

```javascript
const isFixed = query.isFixed();
```

Returns *true* if any of the nodes is hidden.

```javascript
const isHidden = query.isHidden();
```

**Is Same**

Returns *true* if any of the nodes is considered identical to any of the other nodes.

- `others` is a query selector string, a *Node*, *HTMLElement*, *DocumentFragment*, *ShadowRoot*, *NodeList*, *HTMLCollection*, *QuerySet* or an array of nodes.
